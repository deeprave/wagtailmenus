What's new?
===========

This completes the migration from Wagtail `model-admin` functionality to `snippets` functionality, introduced in Wagtail 5.0 and deprecated in Wagtail 6.0. `wagtail-menus` is now compatible with Wagtail 6.0 and Python 3.12.

Django 4.1 is no longer supported; the minimum version is now Django 4.2.

Minor changes & bug fixes
