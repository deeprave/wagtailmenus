What's new?
===========

Wagtail 6 will deprecate the `wagtail.contrib.modeladmin` module in favour of `wagtail.snippets`. A new maintenance package, called `wagtail-modeladmin` was released to provide a smooth transition. This release adds `wagtail-modeladmin` support. It's a stop-gap measure to provide clean support for Wagtail 5.1 while a more permanent Snippet-based solution is developed.

Minor changes & bug fixes
=========================

* Update testing for Wagtail 5.0 and Django 4.2.
* Dropped support for Django 4.1.
